# How to use the admin interface

Message me if you have questions.

## Uploading images

From the main admin page, click on "Images" and then the "ADD IMAGE UPLOAD" button (top right corner). Set the title to something descriptiveâ€”the slug field will automatically be populated from there. You can think of the slug as the (unique) name which you'll use to refer to this file in order to embed it within an article.

For example, if you upload an image with the slug `test-image-1`, you can embed it within an article using the following code:

```
[img:test-image-1]
```

If you want to add a caption below it:

```
[img:test-image-1 This is a caption]
```

## Previewing articles

To preview an article before it's published, make sure the "Published" field (under the image) is unchecked, and click the "View on site" button (top right) on the article edit page after the article has been created.

## Formatting

We use markdown for formatting. For tips: [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
